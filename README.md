# Bangla CrossHair

Bangla CrossHair is a project dedicated to developing a strong bangla OCR Engine for enhancing precision in extracting and analysing Bangla textual data from a graphic.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Collection**: Includes Bangla words, characters, and textbook data across different styles and formats.
- **High-Quality Images**: Each character is stored as a high-resolution image for accurate analysis.
- **Categorized Data**: Characters are neatly organized into categories for ease of use.
- **Versatile Applications**: Suitable for OCR training, Bangla language studies, and AI model development (coming soon).

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:
- `Code/`: Contains the code associated with our study.
- `Images/`: Includes all the images associated with our study.
- `Results/`: You can find the results of a comparative study on PyTesseract and Easy OCR in the results folder.
